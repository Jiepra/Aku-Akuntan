## Project Setup

### Environment Configuration

This project requires environment variables for Firebase and Google AI API. Follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (this file is git-ignored for security)

2. Copy the content from `.env.example` to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Update the values in your `.env` file with your actual API keys:
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Your Firebase API key
   - `VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`: Your Google AI API key
   - Other Firebase configuration values as needed
